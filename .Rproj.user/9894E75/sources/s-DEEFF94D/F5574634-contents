*Building packages with R and including data*

`r tufte::margin_note('R: Building packages and including data')`

I updated my R package aewr, which includes four datasets. I learned that in order to include the datasets in the package I have to capitalize the "d" in "RData". Moreover in order to get lazy loading to work, I have to build the package before uploading it (ctrl+shift+b),

I will try to write a logbook. This is the first entry. I mainly worked on setting it up. Tomorrow I would like to finish the Strike revision and polish this logbook. Maybe also read a paper or two. Let's see. 

```{r ,fig.margin = TRUE,echo=FALSE, warnings=FALSE, message=FALSE}
df<-read_csv("progress20200630.csv")
df<-df%>%mutate(level=factor(level, ordered = TRUE, 
      levels = c("Under Review","Working Paper",
                 "Presentation","Results", "Data")),
      project=factor(project, ordered = TRUE, 
      levels = c("Polaris","Crowding","Pareto","Strike","Grading","Antibiotics","CHX","IGM", "Grading Bias","Income Risk","School choice","Social housing")))
ggplot(df,aes(x=project,y=progress,fill=level))+
  geom_bar(stat="identity")+ coord_flip()+
  theme_minimal()+labs(x=" ",y="Progress", fill=" ",title="June 30,2020")+
  theme(legend.position = 'bottom')+ 
  scale_fill_brewer(palette="Set3")
```
