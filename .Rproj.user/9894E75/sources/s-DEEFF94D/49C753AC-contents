## 1 Create a chart 

*In this section we load data into R and create a chart using this data.*

Let's say that we would like to create a line chart of the income shares in the United Kingdom. In Microsoft Excel we would do this using the following steps:

1. Open the data in Microsoft Excel
2. Select "Insert"
3. Select "Line chart"
4. Select "Select Data"
5. Select the data for the horizontal axis 
6. Select the data for the vertical axis 

In R we can load data and create a line chart by asking R to run two lines of "code". A code is basically just written instructions that replace our "mouse clicking" in Microsoft Excel. So instead of using the mouse to click on "File" and then "Open" and then "Browse" and  so on, we use the "R language" to tell R to do this.  The box below contains your first R code. In programming-based software we first write some code and then tell the software to "execute" or "run" this code.  You can run the code below  by clicking "Run Code". Try it!


```{r first-chart1, exercise=TRUE,  warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
wid_data<-wid_uk_t1
ggplot(data=wid_data,aes(x=Year,y=Income_share))+geom_line()

```
